(a)  Calix and Company agree to keep in confidence, and will cause their respective Representatives (as defined below) to keep in confidence, all Confidential Information disclosed to them and will use such Confidential Information only for the Purpose. Recipient will use the same standard of care to prevent the disclosure of Confidential Information to any third party that the Recipient uses to protect its own Confidential Information of a similar nature, but in any event not less than a reasonable standard of care. Recipient may disclose Discloser’s Confidential Information to Recipient’s directors, employees, advisors and consultants (“Representatives”) who (i) have a need to know the information in connection with their duties and (ii) are parties to confidentiality agreements with Recipient that protect Discloser’s Confidential Information with terms no less stringent than those in this Agreement. Recipient will be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by its Representatives. Recipient agrees to notify Discloser in writing of any actual or suspected misuse, misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information of Discloser which may come to Recipient’s attention.
(b)  Without Discloser’s prior written consent, Recipient will not, and will direct its Representatives not to, disclose to any person either the fact that discussion or negotiations are taking place concerning cooperative activities or the status thereof.

(iv)	is lawfully received by Recipient from another party who had no duty of confidentiality to Discloser.
	If Recipient is compelled pursuant to legal proceeding or otherwise required by law to disclose Discloser’s Confidential Information, then before any such disclosure Recipient will promptly notify Discloser so Discloser may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy (with which Recipient agrees to reasonably cooperate if so requested by Discloser) and/or waive compliance with this Agreement.
