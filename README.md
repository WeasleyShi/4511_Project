## Instruction Manual--NDA Processing Tool

Welcome to the NDA Processing Tool! This tool is designed by Weijian Shi, Shaoxiong Jia, and Yichen Li. The purpose is
to help you efficiently process Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) documents. Please follow
the instructions below for a seamless experience.

### Why This Tool?
In the NDA (None Disclosure Agreement), it always has some dealbreaking words. In different clauses, certain words could be treated
as "deal-breaking". For instance, in the "Disclosure" section, the word "exclusively" is not appropriate,
since in the current stage, both party in the agreement is only signing a non-disclosure agreement, rather than an 
official cooperation contract. Our end-to-end solution aims to detect these errors and provide modification suggestions
to the user. Check out the pipeline's flow chart and instructions below!

### First Use

1. Click on the three dots located to the right of the folder.
2. Select "Move to" and choose "My Drive."

### Operation Process

3. Upload your Docx file and rename it as "NDA.docx." Make sure to delete the existing "NDA.docx" file if present.
4. Choose between two available options:
   - Option 1: **Only Dealbreaker NDA Specialized Search.ipynb**
   - Option 2: **Only Dealbreaker NDA Global Search.ipynb**
5. Open the corresponding `.ipynb` file.
6. Click on "Runtime" in the menu bar and select "Run all" (or simply press Ctrl + F9).
7. Verify at Googleâ€™s double-confirmation by clicking "Yes" or "Confirm" twice.
8. Wait for the below running bar to show "all complete," then close the page directly.
9. You will now see a new docx file named "NDA_db_result.docx."
10. Download this docx file to your local machine.
11. Open the local file to access the desired content. If you are not satisfied with the result, you can try a different method starting from step 1.

### Some Noteworthy Matters

- **Do not modify the code:** Please refrain from making any changes to the provided code.
- **Deleting the original NDA.docx:** After successfully downloading the new docx file, remember to delete the original "NDA.docx" to avoid confusion.
- **Technical Support:** If you encounter any issues or accidentally delete important files, please contact our technical team at ws2679@columbia.edu for assistance.

### Model Selection

- **Only Dealbreaker NDA Specialized Search.ipynb:** This option uses Specialized Search Logic to process NDA documents.
- **Only Dealbreaker NDA Global Search.ipynb:** This option uses Global Search Logic to process NDA documents.

### Pending Search Methods

In the "Pending Search Method" folder, you will find two additional algorithms that incorporate the use of synonyms:

- **Pending: Dealbreakers and Synonyms NDA Specialized Search.ipynb**
- **Pending: Dealbreakers and Synonyms NDA Global Search.ipynb**

Please note that the technical use of these two methods is still under negotiation, and they have been placed in the pending folder.
